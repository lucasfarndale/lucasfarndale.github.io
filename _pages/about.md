Hi, I'm Lucas. My [research](/projects/) involves developing deep learning methods to solve problems in cancer research.

I am part of the [Insall lab](https://www.beatson.gla.ac.uk/beatson-research/beatson-research-groups/robert-insall-cell-migration-and-chemotaxis.html) at the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, and the [Yuan lab](https://kyuanlab.org/) in the University of Glasgow's School of Computing Science.
